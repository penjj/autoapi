- For GitHub Enterprise Server, this endpoint will only list repositories available to all users on the enterprise.
- Pagination is powered exclusively by the `since` parameter. Use the [Link header](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.0/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#link-header) to get the URL for the next page of repositories.
